    "1. **Ambiguity in Interaction Elements:** The 'Select all' checkbox in the first list item could be mistaken for a regular list item checkbox. It needs to be more visually distinct to indicate its unique functionality. (Severity: High)",
    "2. **Inconsistent Background Colors:** The background colors of the list items are inconsistent. The 'Select all' list item has a different background color compared to the other list items. This disrupts visual hierarchy and consistency. (Severity: Medium)"

    "1. **Distinct Visual Treatment for 'Select all' Checkbox:** Modify the visual design of the 'Select all' checkbox to make it more distinct. This could include changing its size, color, or adding a label or icon that clearly indicates its function.",
    "2. **Consistent Background Colors:** Ensure that all list items, including the 'Select all' item, have a consistent background color to maintain visual hierarchy and consistency."
