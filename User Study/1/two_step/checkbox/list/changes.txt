  "violations": [
    "1. **Inconsistent Leading Elements:** The leading elements (radio buttons, checkboxes, and switches) in the list items are not consistent. This can disrupt visual hierarchy and consistency in the list's appearance. (Severity: High)",
    "2. **Divider Placement:** Dividers are missing between some list items, which can make the list harder to scan and disrupt the visual hierarchy. (Severity: Medium)"
  ],
  "changes": [
    "1. **Standardize Leading Elements:** Ensure that all leading elements (radio buttons, checkboxes, and switches) are consistently aligned and styled across all list items to maintain visual consistency.",
    "2. **Add Dividers:** Add dividers between list items where they are missing to improve scannability and maintain a clear visual hierarchy."
