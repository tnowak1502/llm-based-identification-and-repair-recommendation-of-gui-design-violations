  "violations": [
    "1. Inconsistent Icon Button Styles: The icon button in the 'Kanäle' section uses the 'standard' configuration while the rest of the interface uses dark-themed configurations. This inconsistency can confuse users about the importance and function of the button. (Severity: High)",
    "2. Icon Weight Difference: The icon in the 'Kanäle' section's icon button appears to have a different weight compared to the other icons in the interface. Icons in the same component should have the same weight to ensure visual consistency. (Severity: Medium)"
  ],
  "changes": [
    "1. Standardize the icon button style in the 'Kanäle' section to match the dark-themed configurations used elsewhere. This will maintain visual consistency and make the button’s function and importance clearer.",
    "2. Ensure that the icon in the 'Kanäle' section's icon button has the same weight as the other icons in the interface. This will provide a more cohesive visual experience."
