  "violations": [
    "1. Bottom Sheet Content: The bottom sheet contains a carousel, which is not typically secondary content. Bottom sheets should contain secondary content, not the main content of the app. This is a moderate violation because it affects the clarity of the app's content hierarchy.",
    "2. Bottom Sheet Height: The bottom sheet appears to be too tall. Bottom sheets should not cover too much of the screen initially. This is a minor violation as it affects usability slightly."
  ],
  "changes": [
    "1. Move the carousel out of the bottom sheet and place it in the main content area of the app.",
    "2. Reduce the height of the bottom sheet so that it does not cover too much of the screen initially."
