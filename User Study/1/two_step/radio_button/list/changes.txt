    "1. **Repetitive List Items:** The list contains multiple instances of 'Nederlands' as a language option. This repetition does not provide any additional information to the user and clutters the interface. (Severity: High)",
    "2. **Inconsistent Leading Elements:** The leading elements for list items are not consistent. Some list items have radio buttons, some have checkboxes, and some have switches. This inconsistency can confuse users. (Severity: Medium)"

  "changes": [
    "1. **Remove Repetitive List Items:** Eliminate the repeated 'Nederlands' entries to ensure each language option appears only once.",
    "2. **Standardize Leading Elements:** Ensure that the leading elements are consistent across similar types of list items. For example, use radio buttons for language selection and checkboxes for email preferences."
