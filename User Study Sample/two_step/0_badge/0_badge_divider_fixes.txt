Violations:
1. The use of full-width dividers (#C1C9BEFF, light grey) between the stacked cards is appropriate, but the height of the dividers (1.0000280141830444px) might be too thin, making them less visible and potentially confusing for users. Material Design Guidelines suggest that dividers should be visible but not bold.


Changes:
1. Increase the height of the dividers slightly to make them more visible. A height of around 2px would maintain visibility without being too bold.
