    "1. **Inconsistent Leading Element Sizes:** The leading elements (monograms) have a height of 40px but are placed in containers with a height of 64px. This can create visual inconsistency. (Severity: Medium)",
    "2. **Trailing-supporting-text Positioning:** The trailing-supporting-text elements have varying left positions, which can disrupt visual alignment and consistency across list items. (Severity: Medium)"

    "1. **Standardize Leading Element Sizes:** Ensure that the height of the containers for the leading elements matches the height of the monograms (40px) to maintain visual consistency.",
    "2. **Align Trailing-supporting-text Elements:** Adjust the left positioning of the trailing-supporting-text elements to ensure they are consistently aligned across all list items."
