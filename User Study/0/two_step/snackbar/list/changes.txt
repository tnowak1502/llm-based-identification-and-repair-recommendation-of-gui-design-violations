  "violations": [
    "1. **Inconsistent Leading Elements:** All leading elements (monograms) are the same size and style, but the height of the containers varies across list items. This inconsistency can disrupt visual hierarchy and consistency in the list's appearance. (Severity: High)",
    "2. **Repetitive Content:** The 'Trailing-supporting-text' elements are repetitive and do not add significant value. This can make the interface feel cluttered. (Severity: Medium)"

  "changes": [
    "1. **Standardize Leading Element Containers:** Ensure that all leading element containers have a consistent height across all list items. This will maintain visual consistency and hierarchy.",
    "2. **Remove Repetitive Trailing-supporting-text:** Consider removing the 'Trailing-supporting-text' elements or consolidating them in a way that reduces repetition and clutter."
