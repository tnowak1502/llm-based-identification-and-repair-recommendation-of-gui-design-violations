    "1. Ambiguous Tab Label ('FILMS'): The label 'FILMS' might be too general and not descriptive enough. Users might not understand what content to expect under this tab.",
    "2. Ambiguous Tab Label ('REVIEW'): Similar to 'FILMS', the label 'REVIEW' is not very specific and could be unclear to users.",
    "3. Badge Placement: The badge on the 'JOURNAL' tab is very small and might not be easily noticeable by users."
  ],
  "changes": [
    "1. Ensure that tab labels are clear and descriptive. Consider renaming 'FILMS' to something more specific like 'Movies' or 'Cinema'.",
    "2. Rename 'REVIEW' to something more specific like 'User Reviews' or 'Critic Reviews' to make it clearer what kind of reviews are being referred to.",
    "3. Increase the size of the badge on the 'JOURNAL' tab or use a different design to make it more noticeable."
