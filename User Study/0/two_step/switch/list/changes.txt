  "violations": [
    "1. **Inconsistent Leading Elements:** The leading elements in the list items are inconsistent. Some items use radio buttons, some use switches, and others use checkboxes. This can disrupt visual hierarchy and consistency in the list's appearance. (Severity: High)",
    "2. **Divider Placement:** Dividers are used inconsistently. Some list items have dividers while others do not. This can make the list appear less organized and harder to scan. (Severity: Medium)"
  ],
  "changes": [
    "1. **Standardize Leading Elements:** Ensure that all leading elements (radio buttons, switches, checkboxes) are consistent across all list items. Since this is a settings screen, using consistent leading elements like switches might be most appropriate.",
    "2. **Consistent Divider Placement:** Use dividers consistently between all list items to enhance the visual separation and organization of the list."
