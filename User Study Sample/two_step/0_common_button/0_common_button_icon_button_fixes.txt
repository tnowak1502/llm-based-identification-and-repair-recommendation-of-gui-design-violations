Violations:
1. Inconsistent Icon Button Weights: The icon buttons in the top app bar and the frame below it have inconsistent icon weights. Some icons appear bolder while others are lighter. According to Material Design 3 guidelines, icons in the same component should have the same weight. (Severity: High)
2. Ambiguous Button Styles: The buttons 'Edit profile' and 'Share profile' have different styles even though they are next to each other and serve similar purposes. This inconsistency can confuse users. (Severity: Medium)


Changes:
1. Standardize the icon weights across all icon buttons within the same component to ensure uniformity.
2. Use the same button style for 'Edit profile' and 'Share profile' to maintain visual consistency and avoid confusion.
