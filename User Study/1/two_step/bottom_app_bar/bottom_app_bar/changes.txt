    "violations": [
        "1. The bottom app bar contains only two icons and a FAB. Material Design 3 guidelines specify that bottom app bars should contain 2 to 5 actions. This is not a severe violation as it still meets the minimum requirement, but it could be improved for better usability.",
        "2. The FAB is placed outside of the bottom app bar, which violates the guideline that an FAB should be placed within the bottom app bar."

        "1. Consider adding one or two more actions to the bottom app bar to make it more functional. For example, you could add a settings icon or a profile icon.",
        "2. Move the FAB into the bottom app bar, ensuring it is placed within the bar and not outside of it."
