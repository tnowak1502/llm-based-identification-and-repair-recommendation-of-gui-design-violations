**General Description and Position in the Mockup:**
- These switches are positioned within a "Leading-element" container.
- They are all aligned at the same vertical position (`top: 12px`) and horizontal position (`left: 16px`).
- The first and second switches are in the "selected" state, indicating active or enabled features, whereas the third switch is in the "unselected" state, indicating an inactive or disabled feature.
- The visual style and colors of the switches closely match the aesthetic seen in the mockup image, where the green indicates active selections, and grey indicates inactive selections.

These switches are likely used to toggle certain options related to the expense entry, as seen in the mockup image where users can select who the expense is for, with each switch representing a different person.
