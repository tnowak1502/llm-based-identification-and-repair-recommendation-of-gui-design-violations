    "Add dividers to group related navigation items together. This will help users scan the drawer quickly and find what they need. For example, you can categorize 'Renting History', 'Inbox', 'Wallet', and 'Coupons' as one group, 'Pricing', 'User Agreement' and 'Privacy' as another, and 'Support' and 'Account Settings' as the last one."
