    "1. **Inconsistent Selection Indicators:** The list items use different types of selection indicators (radio buttons, checkboxes, switch). This can disrupt the visual consistency and create ambiguity for the user. (Severity: High)",
    "2. **Misalignment of Leading Elements:** The leading elements (checkboxes) in List Items 7, 8, and 9 are misaligned compared to other list items, which can disrupt the visual consistency. (Severity: Medium)"
