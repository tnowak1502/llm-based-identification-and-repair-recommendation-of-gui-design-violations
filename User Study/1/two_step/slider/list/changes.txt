  "violations": [
    "1. **Inconsistent Use of Dividers:** Dividers are used inconsistently between the list items. Some items have dividers while others do not. This can make the list appear visually cluttered and inconsistent. (Severity: High)",
    "2. **Proximity of Checkbox Elements:** The checkboxes for 'Daily', 'Weekly', and 'Monthly' email settings are very close to the left edge of the screen. This violates the guideline that elements should not be too close to the edges to ensure a clean layout and prevent accidental touches. (Severity: Medium)"

    "2. **Adjust Checkbox Proximity:** Move the checkboxes for 'Daily', 'Weekly', and 'Monthly' email settings slightly to the right to ensure they are not too close to the left edge of the screen."
