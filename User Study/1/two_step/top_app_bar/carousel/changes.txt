  "violations": [
    "1. Carousel items too small: The items in the carousel have a very low width, which makes it difficult to recognize the content. This is especially true for the first item.",
    "2. Excessive use of carousels with many items: There are three separate carousels, each with four items visible simultaneously. This can lead to visual clutter and make the user interface overwhelming."
  ],
  "changes": [
    "1. Increase the width of the carousel items to ensure that the content is easily recognizable.",
    "2. Reduce the number of visible items in the carousels to three, if applicable. Alternatively, consider combining the carousels or displaying fewer items in a more digestible format."
