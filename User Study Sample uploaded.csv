"Violations:
1. The color of the divider in the 'Hi, Firstname Lastname!' section (#000000FF, Black) is too bold and visually disruptive. Material Design Guidelines suggest that dividers should be visible but not bold.

Changes:
1. Change the color of the divider in the 'Hi, Firstname Lastname!' section to a more neutral and less bold color, such as #C1C9BEFF (light grey), to make it less disruptive while still maintaining visibility.",../User Study Sample/one_step/0_divider/0_divider_divider_combined.jpg,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wOQZ8Xo4Ds5rCJ43wJQSi61KPh1GztXK/view?usp=drivesdk,
"Violations:
1. The FABs are not placed in the bottom right corner of the screen. Instead, they are scattered in different positions. According to Material Design guidelines, FABs should be placed in the bottom right corner to be easily accessible using thumbs. 2. The FABs are overlapping with other elements, such as the badge and the bottom app bar. FABs should be placed above other components without overlapping them.

Changes:
1. Relocate the FABs to the bottom right corner of the screen, ensuring they do not overlap with each other or other elements. 2. Ensure the FABs are placed above the bottom app bar without overlapping it.",../User Study Sample/one_step/0_fab/0_fab_fab_combined.jpg,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eOatYr0Sx0htKbyu-lDZ5peA4OXfW7SQ/view?usp=drivesdk,
"Violations:
The slider's handles are too small, which makes them difficult to interact with. Additionally, the slider's inactive track dots are unnecessary and might clutter the UI.

Changes:

"Violations:
1. Inconsistent Icon Button Emphasis: The icon buttons for 'Share' and 'Bookmark' use the 'standard' configuration, which has the lowest emphasis according to Material Design 3 guidelines. These actions might be important enough to warrant a higher emphasis configuration like 'filled' or 'tonal' to make them more noticeable. (Severity: Medium)

Changes:
Change the 'standard' configuration of the icon buttons to 'filled' for higher emphasis and better visibility.",../User Study Sample/one_step/1_bottom_sheet/1_bottom_sheet_icon_button_combined.jpg,https://drive.google.com/file/d/14MgkzK5RxTONW_hZ0RuVFw4Lvd27lC40/view?usp=drivesdk,
"Violations:
1. Carousel items too large: The carousel items are too wide, causing only one item to be fully visible at a time. This does not utilize the available space efficiently. 2. Missing 'Show All' button: A 'Show All' button is recommended next to the carousel.

Changes:
1. Reduce the width of the carousel items to show at least two items at a time.
2. Add a 'Show All' button next to the carousel.

"Violations:
The current navigation bar uses a background color (#EBEFE7FF) that may not provide enough contrast with the icons and text, potentially violating accessibility guidelines for sufficient color contrast.

1. Placement issue: The FAB is placed in the bottom right corner, but it overlaps with the bottom app bar. According to Material Design guidelines, FABs should be placed above the bottom app bar and not overlap with it. Severity: high. 2. Color contrast: The icon inside the FAB has insufficient contrast against the FAB background. The icon color should be more distinct to ensure accessibility. Severity: medium.

The segmented button 'Segment-start' includes both an icon and a label, while 'Segment-end' includes only an icon. According to Material Design 3 guidelines, each segment of a segmented button should be styled the same way and should not mix icon and text segments.

"Violations:
The top app bar in the mockup uses a small-centered configuration, which should be used for the main root page of an app. However, the left-aligned leading icon and the right-aligned trailing icon are not appropriate for a centered configuration. The headline text should be centered with no leading or trailing icons.

"Violations:
The divider below the volume section is a full-width divider, but the section below it (language selection) is related content. According to Material Design 3 Guidelines, an inset divider should be used to separate related content within a section.

"Violations:
1. Positioning issue: The FAB is located near the top right of the screen. According to Material Design guidelines, FABs should be placed in the bottom right corner to be easily accessible using thumbs. This violation is quite severe because it affects the usability and accessibility of the FAB. 2. Overlapping issue: The FAB is placed in a position where it might overlap with other content, making it difficult for users to distinguish interactable areas. This violation is moderately severe because it can lead to confusion about the interactable areas and impede the visibility of other content.

Changes:
1. Reposition the FAB to the bottom right corner of the screen to improve accessibility and adherence to the guidelines.

"Violations:
1. The use of a full-width divider below the 'Volume' section is appropriate. However, the divider's color (#C1C9BEFF) might be too light, potentially making it less visible and thereby reducing its effectiveness in separating sections. Material Design Guidelines suggest that dividers should be visible but not overly bold.
2. The divider's position might be too close to the 'Volume' section, which could make the visual separation less effective. Material Design Guidelines suggest using dividers with enough spacing to clearly separate sections.


Changes:
1. Adjust the color of the divider to a slightly darker shade to ensure it is visible but not overly bold. A color like #B0B0B0FF could be more appropriate.
2. Ensure there is adequate spacing between the 'Volume' section and the divider to enhance the visual separation. Adding a few more pixels of space above the divider can make the separation clearer.

"Violations:
1. Inconsistent Icon Button Weights: The icon buttons in the top app bar and the frame below it have inconsistent icon weights. Some icons appear bolder while others are lighter. According to Material Design 3 guidelines, icons in the same component should have the same weight. (Severity: High)
2. Ambiguous Button Styles: The buttons 'Edit profile' and 'Share profile' have different styles even though they are next to each other and serve similar purposes. This inconsistency can confuse users. (Severity: Medium)


Changes:
1. Standardize the icon weights across all icon buttons within the same component to ensure uniformity.
2. Use the same button style for 'Edit profile' and 'Share profile' to maintain visual consistency and avoid confusion.

2. The snackbar messages cover the bottom app bar, which should not happen. Snackbars should appear above the bottom app bar and not cover it.


Changes:
1. Move the FAB into the bottom app bar and place it in a consistent position, such as the center or right side of the bottom app bar.
2. Adjust the position of the snackbar messages so that they appear above the bottom app bar, ensuring they do not cover it.

2. Misalignment of Text Labels: The text labels 'Share' and 'Bookmark' are not consistently aligned. 'Share' is left-aligned, while 'Bookmark' is slightly off-center. Text labels should be consistently aligned to ensure a clean and cohesive look. (Severity: Medium)


Changes:
1. Standardize the weight and color of the icons inside the icon buttons to ensure they match. This will improve visual consistency and make it clear that these buttons are part of the same component group.
