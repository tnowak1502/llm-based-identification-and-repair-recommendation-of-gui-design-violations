  "violations": [
    "1. The bottom app bar contains only two icons and a FAB. According to Material Design 3 guidelines, a bottom app bar should contain 2 to 5 actions. However, in this case, the FAB seems redundant since the 'reply' action is already present in the bottom app bar.",
    "2. The FAB is placed outside the bottom app bar, which is against the guidelines as it should be contained within the bottom app bar."
  ],
  "changes": [
    "1. Remove the FAB from the bottom app bar and place it inside the bottom app bar.",
    "2. Add one more action icon to the bottom app bar to ensure it has at least three actions."
