Violations:
1. Placement issue: The FAB is placed in the bottom right corner, but it overlaps with the bottom app bar. According to Material Design guidelines, FABs should be placed above the bottom app bar and not overlap with it. Severity: high. 2. Color contrast: The icon inside the FAB has insufficient contrast against the FAB background. The icon color should be more distinct to ensure accessibility. Severity: medium.

Changes:
1. Relocate the FAB to be above the bottom app bar without overlapping it. 2. Adjust the color of the icon inside the FAB to ensure better contrast.
