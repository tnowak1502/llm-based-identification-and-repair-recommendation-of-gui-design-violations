    "1. The divider between the 'Volume' section and the 'Language' section is a full-width divider. Given that 'Volume' is a setting and 'Language' is another setting, they are related in the context of user settings.

    "1. Replace the full-width divider with an inset divider to group the related settings more subtly and improve the visual hierarchy."
