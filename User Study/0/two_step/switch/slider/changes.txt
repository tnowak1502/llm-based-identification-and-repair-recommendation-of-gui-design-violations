  "violations": "1. The handle of the slider is not clearly distinguishable from the track, which might make it difficult for users to identify the interactive part of the slider. This violates the guideline that it should never be ambiguous which parts of the UI can be interacted with. 2. The slider's inactive track color is very close to the active track color, which might make it difficult to differentiate between the selected and unselected portions of the slider. This could affect the visual hierarchy and clarity of the information presented.",
  "changes": "1. Change the color of the handle to make it more distinguishable from the track. This will help users easily identify the interactive part of the slider. 2. Adjust the color contrast between the active and inactive tracks to ensure that users can clearly differentiate between the selected and unselected portions of the slider.",
