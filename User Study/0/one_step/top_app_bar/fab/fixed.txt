  "violations": "1. The FAB is located near the bottom right corner of the screen, but it is not in the exact bottom right corner and overlaps with the carousel content. FABs should be placed in the bottom right corner to be easily accessible using thumbs and should not overlap other content. This violation is quite severe because it affects the usability and accessibility of the FAB. 2. The FAB icon appears to be smaller than the recommended size. Icons in FABs should have a clear and simple design and be large enough to be easily recognizable. This violation is moderately severe because it can lead to confusion about the FAB's purpose.",
  "changes": "1. Reposition the FAB to the exact bottom right corner of the screen to improve accessibility and adherence to the guidelines. Ensure it does not overlap the carousel content. 2. Adjust the size of the FAB icon to make it larger and more recognizable.",
