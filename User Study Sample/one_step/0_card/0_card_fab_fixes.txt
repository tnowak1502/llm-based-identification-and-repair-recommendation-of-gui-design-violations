Violations:
1. Positioning issue: The FAB is located near the top right of the screen. According to Material Design guidelines, FABs should be placed in the bottom right corner to be easily accessible using thumbs. This violation is quite severe because it affects the usability and accessibility of the FAB. 2. Overlapping issue: The FAB is placed in a position where it might overlap with other content, making it difficult for users to distinguish interactable areas. This violation is moderately severe because it can lead to confusion about the interactable areas and impede the visibility of other content.

Changes:
1. Reposition the FAB to the bottom right corner of the screen to improve accessibility and adherence to the guidelines. Ensure it does not overlap with any navigation or bottom app bars.
