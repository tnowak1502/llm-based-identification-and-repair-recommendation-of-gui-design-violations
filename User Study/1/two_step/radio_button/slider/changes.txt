  'violations': "1. The slider's handle and track design are clear and distinguishable, but the inactive track color (#B5F1BDFF) and the active track color (#326940FF) are quite similar in lightness, which might reduce the visual distinction between the active and inactive parts of the track. This could affect the clarity of the user's selection. 2. There is no clear indication of the current value of the slider (e.g., a numeric value), which might make it difficult for users to know the exact volume level they are setting.",
  'changes': "1. Increase the contrast between the active track color and the inactive track color to make the distinction more apparent. Consider using a darker or more saturated color for the active track or a lighter color for the inactive track. 2. Add a numeric value indicator near the slider handle to display the current volume level. This will help users understand the exact value they are setting.",
