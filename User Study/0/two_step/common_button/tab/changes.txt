  "violations": [
    "1. Icon Weight Consistency: The icons used in the tabs do not have consistent weights. The 'grid_on' icon appears to have a different weight compared to the 'video_library' and 'person_pin' icons. This inconsistency can make the UI look unbalanced and less professional.",
    "2. Visual Hierarchy: The indicator bar under the selected tab icon is not very prominent. This can make it difficult for users to quickly identify the currently selected tab."
  ],
  "changes": [
    "1. Ensure that all icons used in the tabs have the same weight. This could involve choosing a consistent set of icons from the same icon family.",
    "2. Make the indicator bar under the selected tab icon more prominent. This could involve increasing its height or changing its color to a more noticeable one."
