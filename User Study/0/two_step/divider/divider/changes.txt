  "violations": [
    "1. The divider in the 'Hi, Firstname Lastname!' section is too bold and dark (#000000FF, Black), which makes it visually disruptive and detracts from the readability of the section it divides. Material Design Guidelines suggest that dividers should be visible but not bold.",
    "2. The dividers in the 'Account Settings' list are inset dividers, but they extend too close to the edges of the container, making them appear almost like full-width dividers. This can make the layout look cluttered."
  ],
  "changes": [
    "1. Change the color of the divider in the 'Hi, Firstname Lastname!' section to a more neutral and less bold color, such as #C1C9BEFF (light grey), to make it less disruptive while still maintaining visibility.",
    "2. Adjust the inset dividers in the 'Account Settings' list to ensure they have sufficient space from the edges of the container. This will help in maintaining a clean and uncluttered layout."
