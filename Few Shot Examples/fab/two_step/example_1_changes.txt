{'violations': '1. Positioning issue: The FAB is located near the bottom center of the screen, which is not the recommended placement. According to Material Design 3 Guidelines, the FAB should be placed in the bottom right corner to be easily accessible using thumbs. This violation is quite severe because it affects the usability and accessibility of the FAB. 2. Overlapping issue: The FAB appears to be slightly overlapping the bottom bar content. FABs should be placed above any bottom app bar or similar element and not overlap with it. This violation is moderately severe because it can lead to confusion about the interactable areas and impede the visibility of the bottom bar content. 3. FAB size: There is only one FAB on the screen, but it is a small one. Small FABS are used to support normal, large, or extended FABs. If there is only one primary action on the screen, using a standard FAB makes more sense.',
 'changes': '1. Reposition the FAB to the bottom right corner of the screen to improve accessibility and adherence to the guidelines. Ensure it does not overlap the bottom bar. 2. Ensure the FAB is placed above the bottom bar without overlapping it. Adjust the position values (Top and Left) accordingly to maintain a clear separation between the FAB and the bottom bar content. 3. Change the small FAB into a standard one.',
