  "violations": [
    "1. **Repetitive Leading Icons:** The leading icons for all list items are identical (person_outline_24px). This can make it harder for users to quickly differentiate between options. (Severity: Medium)",
    "2. **Divider Alignment:** The dividers in the list items are not full-width. According to Material Design 3 guidelines, dividers should either be full-width or inset. (Severity: Low)"
  ],
  "changes": [
    "1. **Differentiate Leading Icons:** Use different icons that are more representative of the specific list item content. For example, use a wallet icon for 'Wallet', a history icon for 'Renting History', a settings icon for 'Account Settings', and a logout icon for 'Log out'.",
    "2. **Adjust Divider Alignment:** Ensure that dividers are either full-width or inset according to the guidelines. In this case, making them full-width would be more appropriate."
