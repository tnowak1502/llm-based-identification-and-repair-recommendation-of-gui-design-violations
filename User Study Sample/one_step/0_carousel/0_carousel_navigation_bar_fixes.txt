Violations:
The current navigation bar uses a background color (#EBEFE7FF) that may not provide enough contrast with the icons and text, potentially violating accessibility guidelines for sufficient color contrast.

Changes:
Change the background color of the navigation bar to a darker color to improve contrast and ensure readability.
