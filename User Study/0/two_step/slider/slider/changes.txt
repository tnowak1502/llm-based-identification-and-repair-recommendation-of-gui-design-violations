  "violations": "1. The slider's 'Handle' component is not clearly distinguished from the 'Track' component. This can make it ambiguous for users to identify which parts of the slider can be interacted with. 2. The 'Scrollbar' component at the bottom of the 'Frame-7' div is not necessary and might confuse users, as it does not seem to serve any functional purpose related to the slider. 3. The 'Track-dot' component is not a standard part of the slider and may add unnecessary visual clutter, making the UI less clean and potentially confusing users.",
  "changes": "1. Ensure that the 'Handle' component is visually distinct from the 'Track' component, possibly by increasing its size or changing its color. 2. Remove the 'Scrollbar' component if it does not serve a specific purpose related to the slider. 3. Remove the 'Track-dot' component if it does not provide any additional functional value to the slider.",
