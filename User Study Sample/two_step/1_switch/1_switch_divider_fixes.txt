Violations:
1. The use of a full-width divider below the 'Volume' section is appropriate. However, the divider's color (#C1C9BEFF) might be too light, potentially making it less visible and thereby reducing its effectiveness in separating sections. Material Design Guidelines suggest that dividers should be visible but not overly bold.
2. The divider's position might be too close to the 'Volume' section, which could make the visual separation less effective. Material Design Guidelines suggest using dividers with enough spacing to clearly separate sections.


Changes:
1. Adjust the color of the divider to a slightly darker shade to ensure it is visible but not overly bold. A color like #B0B0B0FF could be more appropriate.
2. Ensure there is adequate spacing between the 'Volume' section and the divider to enhance the visual separation. Adding a few more pixels of space above the divider can make the separation clearer.
