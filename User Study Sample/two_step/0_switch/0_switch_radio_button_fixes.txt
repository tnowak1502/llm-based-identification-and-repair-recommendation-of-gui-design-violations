Violations:
1. The radio buttons are nested within a div with the same top and left positions, which makes them appear as if they are overlapping. This can cause confusion as to which radio button is selected. 2. There is no preselected option for the radio buttons, which is against the guideline that there should always be a preselected option when using radio buttons.

Changes:
1. Ensure that the radio buttons are not overlapping by adjusting their top and left positions. 2. Set one of the radio buttons as the preselected option.
