    "1. Ambiguous Tab Label ('FILMS'): The label 'FILMS' is not clear enough. It might not be immediately obvious to users what content they will find under this tab, which can cause confusion.",
    "2. Ambiguous Tab Label ('REVIEW'): Similarly, the label 'REVIEW' is not specific enough. Users might not understand what kind of reviews are being referred to.",
    "3. Ambiguous Tab Label ('LISTS'): The label 'LISTS' is also vague and does not provide enough context about the content.",
    "4. Ambiguous Tab Label ('JOURNAL'): The label 'JOURNAL' is not specific enough and might confuse users about the content it holds."
  ],
  "changes": [
    "1. Ensure that tab labels are clear and unambiguous. For example, instead of 'FILMS', use a more descriptive label like 'Movies'.",
    "2. Instead of 'REVIEW', use a more specific label like 'User Reviews' or 'Critic Reviews'.",
    "3. Instead of 'LISTS', use a more descriptive label like 'Watch Lists' or 'Favorite Lists'.",
    "4. Instead of 'JOURNAL', use a more specific label like 'Personal Journal' or 'Movie Journal'."
